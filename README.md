Our project is to create a Chess Mixed Reality Video Game to be used on Hololens. The video game will have multiplayer features. 

## Development & Testing Tools:

    - Unity
    - Mixed Reality Toolkit 
    - C#
    - Azure

## Progress:

The following features have been successfully implemented:

- Scaled down board, pieces and highlights as per the Hololens demo.

- When a player is in check, they now must make a move that takes themselves out of check 
- Console will print checkmate when checkmate occurs, and stalemate if a stalemate occurs
- Multiplayer functionality

The project is being created with Unity and MRTK. The new features for the game are being tested locally and on a Hololens when possible. 

The CI/CD pipeline has been devloped using Azure. Unit tests have been written too.
